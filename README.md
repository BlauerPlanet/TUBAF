# TUBAF

## FECOFINAL.CSL

This is an adjusted version of the CSL-File for the Chairs of Geoscience (Professuren fÃ¼r Geowissenschaften) from the TU Dresden (year 2023, https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/geo/geographie/humangeo/studium/handreichung-wissenschaftlich-arbeiten-und-schreiben) for the FECO Online-Journal. 

The in-line citation should correspond well to the formatting rules of the Freiberg Ecology online (FECO) Journal of the Working Group of Biology and Ecology at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg (https://tu-freiberg.de/fakultaet2/bio/biologie-oekologie/feco-freiberg-ecology-online/feco-formatrichtlinien). 

However in the Bibliography, some minor tweaks from the user could be necessary (e.g. adding missing spaces (Leerzeichen); adding unpubl. next to the year of unpublished thesis).

## How to use within Word

Check if the Zotero Word for Windows Integration is installed and enabled. (Tools>Add-ons)
Then you can choose Freiberg ecology online within the first use of Zotero in a new document.

Some tips:
If you have two documents with the same author and year, check that the author format (either Max Mustermann or Mustermann, Max) is for both the same. Then you will get the (Mustermann 20xx a&b) in the inline citations and the a and b in the corresponding bibliography entrys. 

For text like: according to Mustermann (20xx) you have to manually edit the inline citation made by Zotero.
